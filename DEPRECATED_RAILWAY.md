## üö® DO NOT USE RAILWAY FOR THIS PROJECT

**Status:** DEPRECATED as of August 20, 2025  
**Migration Status:** COMPLETED ‚úÖ  
**Current Infrastructure:** AWS (RDS + App Runner)

## Why Railway was deprecated

1. **Reliability Issues**: Railway infrastructure experienced frequent outages
2. **Database Export Failures**: Unable to export data due to timeout issues
3. **Limited Control**: Insufficient infrastructure customization options
4. **Migration Completed**: Successfully migrated to AWS with improved reliability

## Current AWS Infrastructure

- **Database**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL 15.14
- **API Hosting**: Local development + AWS App Runner (planned)
- **Connection String**: `postgresql://postgres:MirrorOS2025Prod@mirroros-prod-db.cw56mwu0gbw6.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres`

## Files Removed

- ‚ùå `railway.json` (removed)
- ‚ùå Railway CLI commands in scripts
- ‚ùå Railway-specific environment configurations
- ‚ùå Railway deployment workflows

## What to use instead

| Old Railway Component | New AWS Component |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Railway Database | AWS RDS PostgreSQL |
| Railway App Hosting | AWS App Runner |
| Railway CLI | AWS CLI |
| Railway Domains | AWS Route 53 + CloudFront |

**DO NOT:**
- Create new `railway.json` files
- Add Railway CLI commands to scripts
- Reference Railway URLs in configurations
- Attempt to deploy to Railway

**DO:**
